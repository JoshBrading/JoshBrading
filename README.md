# Josh Brading - Game Developer

I am a game developer with a degree in Information Technology and a specialization in Game Development from the New Jersey Institute of Technology. Growing up playing games like Halo, Call of Duty, and Minecraft, I developed a passion for programming and modding games. This passion eventually turned into a desire to develop games myself, and I have been pursuing this goal through my education and personal projects. As part of my specialization, I have taken courses on 2D and 3D game engine development, full stack web development, and game development using engines like Unity and Unreal.

## Skills

- **Game Development:** I have experience building 2D and 3D game engines from scratch, as well as creating games using engines like Unity and Unreal. Through these projects, I have gained a strong foundation in memory management, entity systems, collision systems, rendering systems, and physics systems. I am particularly interested in game engine development, gameplay engineering, and UI engineering.

- **Web Development:** I have experience building web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS. I have also worked with technologies such as RabbitMQ, MySQL, and NodeJS. My notable web development project is SteamQuiz, a group project that utilizes the Steam API to build a database of games and presents users with quizzes based on the games' descriptions and tags.

- **Backend Development:** I have experience building backend systems using languages such as Python, NodeJS, and Java, as well as frameworks such as Flask and Express.

- **Database Development:** I have experience designing and implementing databases using MySQL and MongoDB, as well as writing queries and stored procedures.

- **RabbitMQ:** I have experience using RabbitMQ to implement message queues and event-driven architectures.

- **Chatbots:** I have experience creating chatbots for Discord and Twitch, including custom commands, moderation tools, a code editor, and natural language processing to detect hate or otherwise unwanted speech in chat.

## Projects

- [**2D Game Engine**](https://github.com/JoshBrading/gameframework2d/tree/final): This is a custom 2D game engine I built from scratch using C and SDL. It includes a functioning entity system, collision system, lighting system, and a demo SWAT game where the user controls a team of 4 and must breach buildings and save hostages.

- [**3D Game Engine**](https://github.com/JoshBrading/gf3d/tree/final_3d-tower-defense): This is a custom 3D game engine I built from scratch using C, SDL2, and the Vulkan Graphics API. It includes a functioning entity system, collision system, and a socket-based networking mode. The demo for this game is a tower defense game styled similar to Plants Vs Zombies.

- [**rtrnBOT**](https://rtrn.gg): I am currently developing a Twitch chatbot called rtrnBOT. This chatbot offers users the ability to create advanced functionality by uploading their own code or using the built-in node-based code editor. It includes features such as custom commands, moderation tools, and natural language processing to identify and filter out inappropriate or unwanted speech in chat.


- [**SteamQuiz**](https://github.com/JoshBrading/IT490): SteamQuiz is a group project between me and 3 other classmates. I am the project manager. The project utilizes the Steam API to build a database of games and presents users with quizzes based on the games' descriptions and tags. Technologies used in the development of this project include RabbitMQ, MySQL, NodeJS, ReactJS, and TailwindCSS.

## Career Goals

As a game developer, my interests lie in engine, gameplay, and UI development, as well as in learning about anti cheat development. In the future, I hope to contribute to the field of game development by creating innovative and immersive gaming experiences for players, and by developing tools and technologies that enhance the integrity and fairness of online games. My long-term goal is to work in engine or anti cheat development and use my skills and expertise to make a positive impact in the industry.
